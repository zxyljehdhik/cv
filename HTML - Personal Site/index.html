        <p>I am a student and entrepreneur that is currently enrolled in Mesa
          Community College. I just finished getting my Associates in Business degree
          and will be continuing my enrollment there to get an Associates in Computer
          Science. I am learning html and css during my free time and I plan to apply
          what I have learned into a career in marketing. I wanted to find a problem,
          create a solution, and sell that solution to my community. Personally, I
          believe that my tribe has the ability to be self-sustainable and be a leader
          in reducing it's carbon footprint here in the US. </p>
